    <div align="center"><h3>Hello, and Welcome :)</h3> 
        <h3 >Seal Team 301 is committed to <b>transparency<b>, <b>perseverance</b> and <b>success</b>.</h3>
        <p>For this Project we are making a charity app that will allow organizations and parties in need to meet and communicate effectively.
          The party in need will look for a registered organization on our platform and they will ask for a donation that they need, if the 
          organization can donate the requested item, it will let the party in need to know. We are using the google maps API to show the
          locations of the organizations and we are using our own in-built chat functionality so that the parties can communicate within our code base.</p>

     [David Roodt(Data-Engineer)](https://github.com/David-Roodt)
    <p>I am in my third year of Computer Science. I switched over from BIT to
focus more on programming and software development over the business
side of IT. I enjoy the problem solving of coding projects and the feeling
of integrating small moving parts into a larger system. I believe we will be
able to overcome any technical requirement of the project at hand.</p>
