        <p><b>Charity-Spot</b> is intended to serve as a platform for organisations who would like to donate items to those in need, and to assist people in need to find the items that they require.</p>
        <p>An interactive map with a set of filters can be used to find items that have been donated. The system also has an AI component that can be used to predict when items will be donated by assisting organisations. We use this information to inform people in need of organisations that are most likely able to assist them if the items they need are not available</p>

<p>I am in my third year of Computer Science. I switched over from BIT to
focus more on programming and software development over the business
side of IT. I enjoy the problem solving of coding projects and the feeling
of integrating small moving parts into a larger system. I believe we will be
able to overcome any technical requirement of the project at hand.</p>
